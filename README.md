# Stirling Engine with Magnets

3D model animated demo of Stirling engine cycle with
magnets. Such engine should work on verly low temperatue
difference like few °C

Videos of actual models with magnets:

[Low Temperature Stirling Motor with neodym magnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzweLbneAXg).

Magnets shift phase of big piston to about 90° and alternate
between 2 positions in off/on "switching" mode, a better
thermal cycle with less moving parts.

Magnet stroke must be larger than big piston stroke.
When magnet and big piston are in topmost position then
big piston should be able to "detach" from magnetic
attraction and fall down with its own weight.
This is possible if distance from magnet to big piston
at top position is a bit larger than distance at bottom
position.

is here explained with small mechanical model (no magnets).
